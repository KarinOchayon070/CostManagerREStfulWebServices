# üí∏ Cost Manager REStful Web Services üí∏

üëã Welcome to Cost Manager REStful Web Services, a project aimed at developing specific parts of REStful Web Services to facilitate the management of daily costs through a client application.

# Exploratory Video üíª
To get started, we invite you to watch our explanatory video on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPFVPwQkEnY&ab_channel=KarinOchayon.

# Database ‚úîÔ∏è
- We have successfully saved the database in MongoDB using the MongoDB Atlas service.
- The data is efficiently organized in collections, including the users and costs collections.
- We have implemented the Computed pattern, ensuring optimal performance.
- The costs are conveniently organized based on the following categories: food, health, housing, sport, education, transportation, and other.
- In the users collection, you will find documents that contain the following properties: id, first_name, last_name, and birthday.
- On the other hand, the costs collection holds documents with properties such as: user_id, year, month, day, id, description, category, and sum.

# Application üë©‚Äçüíª
- Our application, developed using the Express.js framework and the Mongoose library, is running seamlessly on the server side.
- We have used JavaScript to implement the REStful web services, adhering to the specified requirements.
- Promises are utilized throughout the codebase to ensure smooth execution.

# The following REStful web service endpoints are available for interacting with the application üîöüü£
  - POST /addcost: Use this endpoint to add a new cost item.
     - For example you can try this in "Postman":
     - post, https://costmanager.onrender.com/addcost, {"user_id": 123124, "day": 12, "month":6, "year": 2023, "description": "pizza", "category": "food", "sum": 50}.
     - Include the following parameters in the request body: sum, category, year, month, day, description, and user_id.
     - The response will be a simple JSON document that describes the added cost, following the same property names.
 -  GET /report: This endpoint allows you to retrieve a detailed report for a specific month and year, using the GET method.
     - For example, you can try this: https://costmanager.onrender.com/report?user_id=123123&month=12&year=2019.
     - Include the parameters year, month, and user_id in the request.
     - The returned JSON document will provide an object with properties representing the possible categories.
     - Each property will contain an array of objects describing cost items. All categories, including those without any costs, will be included in the response.
 -  GET /about: Use this endpoint to obtain information about the developers involved in this project.
     - For example, https://costmanager.onrender.com/about.
     - It returns a JSON array containing objects that describe each developer.
     - The object properties include firstname, lastname, id, and email.
